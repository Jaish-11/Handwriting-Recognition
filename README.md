This project presents a deep learning approach for handwritten text recognition utilizing the Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) architecture implemented using the Keras library and TensorFlow backend. The objective is to develop a system capable of recognizing and transcribing handwritten text from image data, with a specific focus on recognizing handwritten names.
The proposed solution employs a CRNN model, which combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layers, to model the sequential nature of handwritten text. This architecture leverages the ability of CNNs to learn spatial patterns while capturing the temporal dependencies in the data using BiLSTM layers.
